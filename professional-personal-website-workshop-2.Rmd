## First, create a website on your personal machine

--

# 1. Create a github repo



--

# 2. Clone the repo into RStudio

--


# 3. In the command line in RStudio
```{r eval=FALSE}
blogdown::new_site(theme = "gcushen/hugo-academic",
                   sample = TRUE, 
                   theme_example = TRUE, 
                   empty_dirs = TRUE,
                   to_yaml = TRUE)
```

---

### Double check the minimum hugo version against what is installed on your machine.  
### [https://themes.gohugo.io/academic](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic)

### Check version from the command line in RStudio
```{r eval=FALSE}
blogdown::hugo_version()
```

### Update if needed from the command line in RStudio and restart R.
```{r eval=FALSE}
update_hugo(force=TRUE)
```

# Congratulations, you have created a website

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Second, publish the website to the internet
--

# We can do that right now! 

--

# [https://app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)  
### Drag and drop the public folder

---

# Change your URL

--

## 1. Create a netlify account through your github account.  

--

## 2. Link to your repo holding your website.
Every time you push to github, your site updates.

--
## 3. Click on site settings, and change site name.

---

# Swap the netlify URL for rbind.io
--

Later tonight, we don't have time right now
--

## Why?

---

# Swap the netlify URL for rbind.io
--

## Why? rbind.io might be easier to say than netlify.com and easier to tell people in fast situations.  
## **This is how I changed my website to mstuart.rbind.io.**

--

# go to github.com/rbind/support and create an issue.

---

# But this website doesn't look right...
--

## You can change anything on this website.

### It's like Mr. Potato Head.

#### Play with it.

---
## Before we start fixing the appearance, 
## there are some settings...
--

### Using netlify means we need to add a file called netlify.toml
**In the command line**
```{r eval=FALSE}
file.create("netlify.toml")
```

--
## Open the file and copy and paste:
```{r eval=FALSE}
[build]
  publish = "public"
  command = "hugo"
[context.production.environment]
  HUGO_VERSION = "0.55.6"
  HUGO_ENV = "production"
  HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO = "true"
[context.branch-deploy.environment]
  HUGO_VERSION = "0.55.6"
```
---
## Add the public/ folder to your .gitignore
--

## Commit and push to github
--

## Open and edit config/_default/params.toml. 
- change the color theme (donâ€™t forget the day/night theme button!)
- change the font
- add a site description and a sharing image (once you push and publish your site with these changes, you can verify your shiny new twitter card [here](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator))

--

## Open and edit config/_default/menus.toml
- each [[main]] entry in this file is an element in your top navbar. Make it how you want it!
---
# Finding your way around
<img src="professional-personal-website-workshop-2_files/figure-html/directory-all-3.jpeg" width = "90%">

---

### Each of the horizontal sections corresponds to one of these "widgets"
Every section has a page  
<img src="professional-personal-website-workshop-2_files/figure-html/directory-side-by-side.jpeg" width = "100%">

---
### You can even create your own sections.
Just copy one of the other widgets and rename it. 
<img src="professional-personal-website-workshop-2_files/figure-html/michelles-directory.jpeg" width = "50%">

---
### Let's change the content
--

## Open content > authors > admin > _index.md

Change the content to describe you.

--

Replace the file avatar.jpg with your head shot renamed avatar.jpg
---
## For any section you don't want, change the widget to active = FALSE.

--

## If you want to add a background photo like a banner, add that background photo to the widget in the Background Photo section.
This is a great place for those unsplash images

# Save the photo to static > img
---

# Change the color scheme

## Copy and paste the custom.css file from the git repo into assets > css
--

## Open config > _default > params.toml

## Change color_theme to "custom"

---
# Everything beyond this point is playing to see what you like.
## Create a site that embodies who you are as a professional.
### I like to throw some personal stuff in there because I'm a human too.

---
## Change the colors in the css

intenet speak for color (hex) = #36caca

hex color picker on google tells us this is a teal like color

I change a color and see what happens, then find and replace all of the occurences of that color.
---
## Mac has a built in color picker called **Digital Color Meter**
that will tell you the color in an image 
- find colors in your background photos and use those for your font colors.
